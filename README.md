Modeling Human Activity Recognition with R

Contains .Rmd and .html files of final assignment for Practical Machine Learning course of the Johns Hopkins / Coursera *Data Science with R* series of courses. Check out the HTML file for seeing the results of running the R markup file.

I add a pdf of the same file as this can be viewed in github, whereas the HTML can not.
